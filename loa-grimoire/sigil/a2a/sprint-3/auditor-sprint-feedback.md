## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk**: LOW

This is a static showcase app with:
- No backend
- No database
- No auth
- No user-submitted content
- No external API calls

The only external data is the local `components.json` file generated by Sigil export.

## Recommendations

None required. Ship it.

## Approval

All security checks pass. Sprint 3 is approved for completion.
