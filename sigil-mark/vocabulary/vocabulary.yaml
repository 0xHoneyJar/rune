# Sigil v4.1 - Vocabulary
# Maps product terms to design recommendations
#
# Philosophy: "Same backend, different feel. Term determines experience."
#
# This is the API surface between Product and Engineering.
# Product defines terms and mental models.
# Engineering implements with appropriate materials.
#
# v4.1 Additions:
# - last_refined: ISO date when term was last updated via /refine
# - 10 core terms: pot, vault, claim, deposit, withdraw, boost, stake, unstake, harvest, connect
