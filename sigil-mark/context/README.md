# Context

Drop-in research, deep dives, and expert insights for active work.

## What Goes Here

- Deep research outputs (from Exa, Firecrawl, manual research)
- Reference implementations you're studying
- Temporary context for current sprint/task
- Expert articles/notes relevant to what you're building

## Difference from Principles

| Principles | Context |
|------------|---------|
| Universal wisdom | Task-specific research |
| Long-lived | Can be ephemeral |
| Distilled patterns | Raw research/notes |

## Usage

Drop files here. Agent loads contextually based on relevance to current task.

Clean up periodically - context that becomes universal wisdom should graduate to `principles/`.
