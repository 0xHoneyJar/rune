## Overview

Our development process follows a structured, six-phase approach:

1. **Planning** → Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. **Architecture** → Software Design Document (SDD)
3. **Sprint Planning** → Sprint Plan
4. **Implementation** → Production Code with Feedback Loop
5. **Review** → Quality Validation and Sprint Approval
6. **Deployment** → Production Infrastructure and Handover

Each phase is handled by a specialized agent with deep domain expertise, ensuring thorough discovery, clear documentation, high-quality implementation, rigorous quality control, and enterprise-grade production deployment.

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

The implementation phase uses a structured feedback loop:

### **Engineer → Senior Lead**
**File**: `docs/a2a/reviewer.md`

The engineer generates a comprehensive report after implementation:
- What was accomplished
- Files created/modified
- Test coverage
- Technical decisions
- Verification steps
- Feedback addressed (if revision)

### **Senior Lead → Engineer**
**File**: `docs/a2a/engineer-feedback.md`

You (as senior technical lead) review the implementation and provide feedback:
- Issues found
- Required changes
- Clarifications needed
- Quality concerns

The engineer will read this file on the next `/implement {sprint}` invocation, clarify anything unclear, fix all issues, and generate an updated report.

---

## Multi-Developer Usage Warning

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This framework is architected for **single-threaded workflows**. The agent system assumes one active development stream at a time.

### Why Multi-Developer Concurrent Usage Breaks

If multiple developers use `/implement` simultaneously on the same project:

1. **A2A File Collisions**:
   - `docs/a2a/reviewer.md` gets overwritten by each engineer
   - `docs/a2a/engineer-feedback.md` is shared across all engineers
   - Engineer A reads feedback intended for Engineer B
   - Reports are overwritten before senior lead can review them

2. **Sprint Status Conflicts**:
   - Multiple engineers update `docs/sprint.md` simultaneously
   - Merge conflicts on task completion status
   - Inconsistent ✅ markers depending on who pushed last

3. **Context Confusion**:
   - Implementation reports reference different code changes
   - Senior lead reviews incomplete or mixed context
   - Feedback becomes ambiguous about which engineer/task it addresses

4. **Broken Feedback Loops**:
   - The A2A cycle is inherently single-threaded
   - Assumes one engineer ↔ one reviewer conversation
   - Parallel conversations in the same files create chaos

### Solutions for Team Collaboration

To adapt this framework for multiple developers, you must modify the structure:

#### Option 1: Developer-Scoped A2A Communication
```
docs/a2a/
├── alice/
│   ├── reviewer.md
│   └── engineer-feedback.md
├── bob/
│   ├── reviewer.md
│   └── engineer-feedback.md
```

**Requires**: Modifying agent prompts to read/write from developer-specific directories.

#### Option 2: Task-Scoped Implementation Reports
```
docs/a2a/
├── sprint-1-task-1/
│   ├── implementation-report.md
│   └── review-feedback.md
├── sprint-1-task-2/
│   ├── implementation-report.md
│   └── review-feedback.md
```

**Requires**: Task-based invocation (e.g., `/implement sprint-1-task-1`) with isolated A2A channels per task.

#### Option 3: External System Integration
- Keep `docs/prd.md`, `docs/sdd.md`, `docs/sprint.md` in git as **read-only shared references**
- Assign sprint tasks via Linear/GitHub Issues
- Conduct A2A communication in issue comments (not files)
- Use PR reviews for code validation instead of A2A files
- Coordinate `docs/sprint.md` updates through a single point of authority (tech lead)

**Advantage**: Leverages existing project management tools and PR workflows that are designed for concurrency.

#### Option 4: Feature Branches with Scoped Documentation
- Each developer works on a feature branch with their own `docs/` snapshot
- A2A communication happens in branch-specific files
- On merge, consolidate sprint status in main branch
- Conflicts resolved during PR review

**Advantage**: Git branching model provides isolation; disadvantage: documentation divergence across branches.

### Recommended Approach

For teams with 2+ developers working concurrently:

1. **Use Linear/GitHub Issues** (already in MCP config) for task assignment and tracking
2. **Keep planning docs** (prd.md, sdd.md, sprint.md) in git as shared, read-only references
3. **Use PR comments** for implementation feedback instead of A2A files
4. **Coordinate sprint status** updates through a designated tech lead who maintains sprint.md
5. **Consider task-scoped branches** if you want to preserve the A2A feedback loop model per task

The current framework's `.gitignore` excludes `docs/` precisely because these are **ephemeral artifacts** for a single-threaded workflow, not durable documentation designed for concurrent multi-developer editing.

## Best Practices

### For All Phases

1. **Answer Thoroughly**: Agents ask questions for a reason—provide detailed answers
2. **Clarify Early**: If an agent's question is unclear, ask them to rephrase
3. **Review Outputs**: Always review generated documents (PRD, SDD, sprint plan)
4. **Iterate Freely**: Use the feedback loop—it's designed for iterative improvement

### For Planning Phase

- Be specific about user personas and pain points
- Define measurable success metrics
- Clearly state what's in scope vs. out of scope
- Document assumptions and risks

### For Architecture Phase

- When presented with proposals, consider long-term maintainability
- Don't over-engineer—choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Validate technology stack choices against team expertise
- Consider operational complexity

### For Sprint Planning

- Be realistic about team capacity
- Prioritize ruthlessly—not everything needs to be in Sprint 1
- Validate dependencies are correctly identified
- Ensure acceptance criteria are specific and measurable

### For Implementation

- **Provide Clear Feedback**: Be specific in `docs/a2a/engineer-feedback.md`
- **Use File References**: Include file paths and line numbers
- **Explain Why**: Don't just say "fix this"—explain the reasoning
- **Test Before Approving**: Run the verification steps from the report

### For DevOps & Infrastructure

- Security first—never compromise on security fundamentals
- Automate everything that can be automated
- Design for failure—everything will eventually fail
- Monitor before deploying—can't fix what you can't see
- Document runbooks and incident response procedures
- Consider cost implications of architectural decisions
- For crypto/blockchain: Proper key management is life-or-death
