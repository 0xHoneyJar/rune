# Agent Documentation Index

## Overview

[6. DevOps Crypto Architect] → Production Infrastructure
```

## Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication

The framework uses structured A2A communication files that enable agents to share context and coordinate work.

### Integration Context (Phase 0)
When the **Context Engineering Expert** has been run, it generates `docs/a2a/integration-context.md`:
- **Purpose**: Provides all downstream agents with organizational workflow context
- **Content**: Available tools, knowledge sources, team structure, context preservation requirements
- **Usage**: All agents check for this file first and adapt their behavior based on organizational integration

### Implementation Feedback Loop (Phases 4-5)
**Sprint Task Implementer** and **Senior Tech Lead Reviewer** use a feedback cycle:

1. **Sprint Task Implementer** generates `docs/a2a/reviewer.md` (implementation report)
2. **Senior Tech Lead Reviewer** reads report and code, provides `docs/a2a/engineer-feedback.md`
3. **Sprint Task Implementer** reads feedback, addresses issues, generates updated report
4. Cycle repeats until **Senior Tech Lead Reviewer** approves

## Key Principles

### 1. Specialization
Each agent has deep expertise in their domain. They bring 15+ years of experience and domain-specific knowledge.

### 2. Structured Workflow
Agents work sequentially, building on previous outputs:
- PRD informs SDD
- SDD guides Sprint Plan
- Sprint Plan drives Implementation
- Implementation validated by Review
- All phases inform Deployment

### 3. Quality Gates
Each phase has validation checkpoints:
- PRD: Complete requirements before architecture
- SDD: Clear design before sprint planning
- Sprint: Actionable tasks before implementation
- Implementation: Production-ready before approval
- Deployment: Enterprise-grade infrastructure

### 4. Feedback-Driven Iteration
Implementation uses feedback loops:
- Implementer → Reviewer → Feedback → Implementer
- Iterate until quality standards met
- No compromises on security or critical issues

### 5. Documentation as Artifact
Every phase produces durable artifacts:
- Documents serve as project memory
- Enable async work and team changes
- Provide context for future decisions
- Support knowledge permanence

## When to Use Each Agent

| Scenario | Agent | Command |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Need to integrate with org tools | Context Engineering Expert | `/integrate-org-workflow` |
| Starting new project/feature | PRD Architect | `/plan-and-analyze` |
| Have PRD, need technical design | Architecture Designer | `/architect` |
| Have PRD+SDD, need task breakdown | Sprint Planner | `/sprint-plan` |
| Ready to implement sprint tasks | Sprint Task Implementer | `/implement sprint-X` |
| Code ready for review | Senior Tech Lead Reviewer | `/review-sprint` |
| Need security audit | Paranoid Auditor | `/audit` |
| Need infrastructure/deployment | DevOps Crypto Architect | `/deploy-production` |
| Need exec summary/stakeholder brief | DevRel Translator | `/translate @doc.md for [audience]` |

## Agent Communication Style

### All Agents Share
- **Questioning mindset**: Ask clarifying questions before proceeding
- **Documentation focus**: Generate comprehensive artifacts
- **Quality emphasis**: No shortcuts, production-ready output
- **Context awareness**: Read all relevant docs before starting
- **Iterative approach**: Refine based on feedback

### Agent-Specific Styles
- **Context Engineering Expert**: Consultative, pragmatic, educational
- **PRD Architect**: Patient, thorough, conversational
- **Architecture Designer**: Technical, precise, justification-focused
- **Sprint Planner**: Strategic, clear, actionable
- **Sprint Task Implementer**: Technical, detailed, autonomous
- **Senior Tech Lead Reviewer**: Critical, constructive, educational
- **DevOps Crypto Architect**: Security-first, pragmatic, transparent
- **Paranoid Auditor**: Brutally honest, security-paranoid, detailed
- **DevRel Translator**: Empathetic, clear, business-focused, accessible

## Multi-Developer Usage

⚠️ **Important**: The framework is designed for single-threaded workflows. For multi-developer teams:

1. Use **Context Engineering Expert** to design integration with:
   - Linear (per-initiative isolation or linear-centric workflow)
   - Discord (community feedback collection)
   - Google Docs (collaborative requirements)

2. Adapt A2A communication:
   - Per-developer directories
   - Per-task scoped reports
   - External system integration (Linear comments, GitHub PR reviews)

3. See the [Multi-Developer Usage Warning](../README.md#multi-developer-usage-warning) for details

## Getting Started

1. (Optional) Start with `/integrate-org-workflow` for organizational tool integration
2. Use `/plan-and-analyze` to create your PRD
3. Use `/architect` to design your system
4. Run `/sprint-plan` to break down work
5. Execute `/implement sprint-1` to start coding
6. Use `/review-sprint` to validate quality
7. Repeat implementation/review until approved
8. (Recommended) Run `/audit` before production deployment
9. Finally `/deploy-production` when ready
